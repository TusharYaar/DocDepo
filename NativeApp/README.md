#DocDepo native app (Expo)

This app uses _**expo**_ and react native to make the app.
For only react native app search for _withoutExpo_ folder

config.js is required for the app to run and contains the following fields:

1. firebase configuration
1. web cliet Id
1. android cliet Id

config files also contains some functions and thus its recommended to use config-template file included and **rename** it to config.js
